  <p>Welcome to my site,</p>
  <p>My name is Ryan and I am a software developer based in Seattle. I have a strong passion for coding and am currently in a web development bootcamp. I have experience with a variety of programming languages and enjoy tackling challenging projects that allow me to learn and grow as a developer.</p>
  <p>When I'm not busy coding, you can find me out on the trails or on the water. I love hiking and sailing and am fortunate to live in a city like Seattle, which offers endless opportunities for both activities. The stunning mountain ranges and waterways here make it the perfect place to indulge in my love of the outdoors.</p>
  <p>In my free time, I also enjoy spending time with friends and family, reading, and running. I am always looking for new adventures and ways to push myself out of my comfort zone.</p>
